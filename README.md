python-music-filenames
======================

A music file utility library to remove special characters from files but still preserve their title's meanings.

This will implement:
  * Removing Special Characters from title name
  * Checking for duplicate files
  * Moving all files in subdirectories to one directory

This was my solution to removing the extra numbers etc to iTunes music files like "01 Skyfall.m4a" becomes "Skyfall.m4a".
